# PagerDuty MVP

This is a Minimum Viable Product writen on Ruby on Rails asked in the technical interview of PagerDuty.

# Requirements:

The app must support adding just the name of a dish, deleting a dish, and viewing all dish names we've added. Don't spend too much time on this minimal viable product - ideally 30-45mins - but the app does have to be complete prior to the interview.
